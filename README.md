## Behavior Driven Development

Specification: Akan Name Generator

When date of birth and gender are inputted in a form to generate akan day names
Then it is calculated to get day born which is equated to an akan name depending on the gender.

When a date is keyed in wrongly
Then an alert message is sent to the user.

When gender selected is male
Then Akan name generated is for male users.
And the day of birth is also generated and displayed to the user.

When gender selected is female
Then Akan name generated is for female users.
And the day of birth is also generated and displayed to the user.
